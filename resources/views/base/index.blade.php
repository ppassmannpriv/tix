    <p>The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Use your fucking hands. Form follows fucking function. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. This design is fucking brilliant. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Respect your fucking craft. Intuition is fucking important. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Must-do is a good fucking master. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” Learn from fucking criticism. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal.</p>
